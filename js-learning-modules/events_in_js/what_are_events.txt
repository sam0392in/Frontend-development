-> HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

-> When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

-> Here are some examples of HTML events:

    - An HTML web page has finished loading
    - An HTML input field was changed
    - An HTML button was clicked
    - Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

-> JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
